# Starting with version 0.02a this mod will use Forge 45.2.0+ (Forge 1.19.4)
This mod offers a variety of music discs and new blocks.

A couple of things this mod adds:

An Advanced Jukebox for playing custom discs
- Custom Music Discs.
- Entities, McAlec (me), TESTIFICATE (>1.9 snapshots Villager), Boykisser (it's overrated, I know).
- Structures (soon).
- Biomes (2 currently).
- A semi-proper "MusicUI" for playing different sounds in Minecraft.

## I do not own/claim any music, pictures, items, or textures that may be deemed to be mine. I own all the assets I have created.

If you have any problems, please don't hesitate to contact me.
