### This mod uses Forge 47.2.0+ _(Forge 1.20.1)_
### We test on latest Forge versions
This mod offers a variety of music discs and new blocks.

A couple of things this mod adds:

An Advanced Jukebox for playing custom discs
- Custom Music Discs.
- Entities:
 -- McAlec (me)
 -- TESTIFICATE (>1.9 snapshots Villager) 
 -- Boykisser (it's overrated, I know)
- Structures (soon).
- Biomes (2 currently).
- A semi-proper "MusicUI" for playing different sounds in Minecraft.



### Wanna make an addon

Put this code in the "repositories" block in build.gradle


```maven {
    // McAlec's Mod repo
    name = "McAlecs"
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McAlec1/mcalecsmod/master/mcmodsrepo/"
```}

Then put this code in the "dependencies" block just below the "repositories" one in build.gradle

```
implementation fg.deobf("net.mcalec.mcalecs:mcalecsmod-0.7:0.7") // McAlec's Mod Repo
```

**I do not own/claim any music, pictures, items, or textures that may be deemed to be mine. I own all the assets I have created.**

If you have any problems, please don't hesitate to contact me.
